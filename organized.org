* Getting Yourself Organized with Org-mode

1. Write it down (capture)
2. Decide if its actionable or not
3. If it is actionable and too big, break it down into smaller tasks
4. Decide the very next action to move towards "Done"
5. /Do the actions/
6. Frequently review the system

#+TITLE: The Basics of Org Mode
* Headlines & Outline Mode

** Level 1 Headline
*** Level 2 Headline A
   
    Some text belonging to the level 2
   
*** Level 2 Headline B

    Some other text belonging to the level 2

* To-Do Keywords

*** TODO Thing 1 that needs to be done
*** IN-PROG Thing 2 that needs to be done
*** WAITING Thing 3 that needs to be done
*** DONE Thing 4 that needs to be done
    CLOSED: [2020-12-03 Thu 21:30]
    
   


We can define custom keywords by adding the header:

#+SEQ_TODO: NEXT(n) TODO(t) WAITING(w) SOMEDAY(s) PROJ(p) | DONE(d) CANCELLED(c)

*** NEXT Thing 1 that needs to be done
*** TODO Thing 2 that needs to be done
*** WAITING Thing 3 that needs to be done
*** SOMEDAY Thing 4 that needs to be done
*** PROJ Thing 5 that needs to be done
*** DONE Thing 6 that needs to be done
    CLOSED: [2020-12-03 Thu 21:33]
*** CANCELLED Thing 7 that needs to be done
    CLOSED: [2020-12-03 Thu 21:33]

The | symbol means that everything on the left side of it are considered actionable items. The symbols on the right side mark finished items. 
The item in the () is a hot-key that can be activated by using C-c C-t inside of an item

*** NEXT Item to do

* Schedule, Deadlines, & Agenda View

* Repeating Tasks

** REPEAT Example Task
   SCHEDULED: <2020-12-05 Tue ++1w>

** Specifying Intervals

We can use the following units to specify the repeat interlude: d (days) w (weeks) m (months) y (year

A single + means that the timestamp will be rescheduled by the interval when the task is marked as done. 
A ++ means reschedule it in the future. It should carry on that time interval
A .+ means take the current date, and add the time unit to it

We can remove the repeating log entries with 
#+STARTUP: nologrepeat

* Tags

Tags are a label for headlines. They add contexts to tasks. 

We can define a set of tags at the beginning of the file. 

#+TAGS: DEPTH(d) IMPLEMENT(i) SKIM(s) ONE-TIME(o)

To assign a tag to a headline, place the cursor in the headline or the block below it and press C-c C-q

** NEXT Example Task 1                                                :DEPTH:
** Example Task 2                                                 :IMPLEMENT:
** Example Task 3                                                      :SKIM:
** Example Task 4                                                     :DEPTH:
** NEXT Example Task 5                                                :DEPTH:

You can assign a free-text tag as well by pressing tab in the options tray

** Example Task 6                                                 :EasyPeasy:

Tags can also be written with an inherited hierarchy

** Example Task 7                                               :MAINTENANCE:
*** Example Task 8                                          :DEPTH:IMPLEMENT:

* Advanced Agenda Views

*** Agenda for Current Week or Day

We can set the default timespan of the agenda view by setting the variable `org-agenda-span` to day, week, month, year.

The other way we can do it is with prefixing of the agenda command. Prefixing is done with C-u and a number. 

So C-u 3 C-c a will call the agenda for 3 days

*** List of all TODO Entries

We can list all the TODO entries by calling C-c a t

We can look at different flags with the N r syntax

*** Entries with a Special TODO Keyword

If we choose shift-t, we can choose multiples. For example, we could do NEXT|TODO to see all the next and todo keywords.
