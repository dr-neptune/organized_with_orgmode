A single + means that the timestamp will be rescheduled by the interval when the task is marked as done. 
A ++ means reschedule it in the future. It should carry on that time interval
A .+ means take the current date, and add the time unit to it

We can remove the repeating log entries with

Tags are a label for headlines. They add contexts to tasks. 

We can define a set of tags at the beginning of the file. 

#+TAGS: DEPTH(d) IMPLEMENT(i) SKIM(s) ONE-TIME(o)

To assign a tag to a headline, place the cursor in the headline or the block below it and press C-c C-q

* Advanced Agenda Views
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       8bac3194-5b58-4caf-8a85-8b1f12b73cb2
  :END:

*** Agenda for Current Week or Day
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID:       c1cd1cae-6df9-4033-a54a-16243a994966
    :END:

We can set the default timespan of the agenda view by setting the variable `org-agenda-span` to day, week, month, year.

The other way we can do it is with prefixing of the agenda command. Prefixing is done with C-u and a number. 

So C-u 3 C-c a will call the agenda for 3 days

*** List of all TODO Entries
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID:       e0932d23-7f24-4167-9597-c40fa940243b
    :END:

We can list all the TODO entries by calling C-c a t

We can look at different flags with the N r syntax

*** Entries with a Special TODO Keyword
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID:       20b4aba5-954f-4cb7-b1d3-d61a2b3c7656
    :END:

If we choose shift-t, we can choose multiples. For example, we could do NEXT|TODO to see all the next and todo keywords. 

*** Match a TAGS/PROP/TODO query
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID:       ec2dc830-e90e-42e1-94d6-24753ab4c497
    :END:

C-c a m will give us the opportunity to enter tags and logical expressions

We could look up tags like MAINTENANCE or DEPTH, or things like 

MAINTENANCE|DEPTH="NEXT"

*** Searching for keywords
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID:       c2bca3c6-7572-460c-9600-c742dd3da244
    :END:

C-c a s does full text search terms. It also supports regular expressions. 

The regular expressions are wrapped in curly braces like {a?Apostol}

* Customized Agenda Views
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       1156af53-3198-46b4-9ce6-ea3ef3b3487d
  :END:

These are two ways to define customized agenda views: 

** Custom Agenda View Editor 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       6ca908b9-8857-46ec-a6e0-27445cec6fa7
   :END:

C-a a s-c

** Directly in the startup file 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       763aa39d-eee0-497a-93f9-d20068ee4b51
   :END:

We can write out views with the variable org-agenda-custom-commands.

Here is an example: 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
'(org-agenda-custom-commands
   '(("A" "Agenda and all NEXTs" tags-todo "DEPTH|IMPLEMENT=\"NEXT\""
      ((org-agenda-span 'day)))
     ("n" "Agenda and all TODOs"
      ((agenda "" nil)
       (alltodo "" nil))
      nil)))
#+END_SRC

* Drawers, Logging, and Quick Notes
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       7fe5de87-3d8a-4886-bea5-4481a4fd6f97
  :END:

Drawers start with a line that has the name of the drawer between colons (:), and are usually written in uppercase. 

There are some reserved names for drawers:

:PROPERTIES:
:END:
This holds special config info on the current item or subtree in the org file. It has to start immediately below the headline. 

:LOGBOOK:
:END:
This is used to log things. 


:OTHER:
Here is some stuff in the drawer
:END:

** What is logging good for?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       b19c098e-8c3c-4882-8e84-1f8a41b86137
   :END:

Logging means we can create a sort of micro-blog for every task that we are doing. Its also a good CYA strategy

:LOGBOOK:
- Note taken on [2020-12-08 Tue 21:04] \\
  Here is another note, with an update
- Note taken on [2020-12-08 Tue 21:04] \\
  This is a test showing that I can log a note inside of a logbook drawer
:END:

** Taking a quick note
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       4bd7fb81-65a9-4db9-894f-669f959bdb04
   :END:

   - Note taken on [2021-01-07 Thu 21:03] \\
     This is a quick note
When the cursor is inside of a task or even on a line with the task in an agenda view, we can just type C-c C-z to open a window where we can write a note. 

   - Note taken on [2020-12-08 Tue 20:56] \\
     This is a quick note

* Archiving
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       f36e90e4-cf04-473e-8468-48542f144206
  :END:

Org offers two archiving methods: 

*Internal Archiving* just sets an :ARCHIVE: tag which disables expanding that entry and prevents it from showing in agendas. This is done with C-c C-x a

** Example Task                                                     :ARCHIVE:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       e89b6d3b-3a5d-401a-8009-9a5217f4e913
   :END:

Stuff done here 

:LOGBOOK:
- Note taken on [2020-12-08 Tue 21:08] \\
  This is a quick note about what was done here
:END:

*Moving Subtrees* means we move the subtree to another file, the archive file. This keeps the org file lean and mean

** Moving Subtrees to an Archive File
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       9045c646-851f-4caa-bd0a-9ee0847fa39a
   :END:

We define an archive file like this: 
#+ARCHIVE: %s_archive::

where %s is the filename of the org file

#+ARCHIVE: archive.org_archive::

We can also set the archive target for a subtree. For example: 

** Books to read 
:PROPERTIES:
:ARCHIVE: read-books.org::* Read Books
:ID:       9e850536-d1cd-4dd1-ab9a-e9c96c358f45
:END:

*** Yet Another Book Read (YABR)
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID:       5a2b251e-e3bc-4b82-9653-5d07ac6a659d
    :END:

mhm 

** Revisiting Archive Files
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       9818567e-7acf-492c-aef8-59e23a0b427e
   :END:

If we wish to search our archives, we could just use grep since it is all plain text

We can also swap to the archive file we know it is in, then switch to the agenda dispatcher C-c a, then < to activate "Buffer, subtree/region restriction" to make it only apply to the current window, then press 's' to search the agenda for what we are looking for.

#+TITLE: Making Things More Smooth

* Automatic Logging of Status Changes
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       d50e65a1-d697-4d55-aec0-9e34330f44b2
  :END:

This will have the system prompt us for a comment when a task occurs. 

#+SEQ_TODO: NEXT(n) TODO(t@/!) WAITING(w) SOMEDAY(s) IN-PROG(p) REPEAT(r) | DONE(d) CANCELLED(c)

The @ indicates that we want to log a timestamp and a note when we change the keyword to TODO. The ! defines that we want to log a time stamp when we change the keyword from TODO to something else

** TODO Something to do
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       ded7173c-b6e7-4407-b497-fc84e4297e5c
   :END:
   :LOGBOOK:
   - State "TODO"       from "WAITING"    [2020-12-09 Wed 21:34] \\
     This thing still must be done
   - State "WAITING"    from "TODO"       [2020-12-09 Wed 21:34]
   - State "TODO"       from "NEXT"       [2020-12-09 Wed 21:34] \\
     This is a thing that must be done
   :END:

If we want to disable logging, especially for repeating tasks, then we can add a line to the PROPERTIES drawer:

  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       55d48809-75df-4d44-945f-0419eddd6f21
  :END:

If we wanted to split one big org file into multiple little ones, we could just copy the items into distinct files -- or we could go deeper into refiling.

** Customizing Refiling
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       bf308ec4-dd47-4316-96ea-92b88767e4a6
   :END:

We need to customize 3 variables for an elegant way to refile items: 

*** org-refile-targets
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID:       c654a7c4-a725-45ec-828c-9cd0f0074af5
    :END:

This defines where refiling can place items. 

*** org-refile-use-outline-path
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID:       c70ea160-d9df-4412-b97b-151602661374
    :END:

This needs to be set to file which means we see the target path including the file name of the org-file where we are placing the item

*** org-refile-allow-creating-parent-nodes
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID:       fbcec336-c9b9-4cea-864f-9156df99fd65
    :END:

This defines if we are allowed to create new parent headlines in the target file. We set this to confirm  if the target we entered would create a new headline

If we want to move the entries to other org files, we can use C-c C-w and choose the target. If we want to copy them, then we could do C-c M-w

We can also set our agenda files to only include one or the other, or both with this elisp:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun org-focus-private()
  "Set focus on private things"
  (setq org-agenda-files '("~/Documents/org/private.org")))

(defun org-focus-work()
  "Set focus on work things"
  (setq org-agenda-files '("~/Documents/org/work.org")))

(defun org-focus-all()
  "Set focus on all the things"
  (setq org-agenda-files '("~/Documents/org/private.org" "~/Documents/org/work.org")))
#+END_SRC

* The First Capture Template
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       dc65377a-2040-400e-ba0b-4899d743f765
  :END:

With capture templates, we can define forms to capture our ideas in a smart way

I bound the key to C-c c. You need to define an org template. In this case, here is the template I used for a work todo: 

* TODO %^{Description} :NEW:
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       9df74c1e-e3f9-4b37-b91f-909c8077dbbd
  :END:
  Desired Outcome: %?
:LOGBOOK:
- Added: %U
:END:

We could also do this in elisp like so: 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; capture templates
(setq org-capture-templates
      '(("W" "Work Templates")
	("Wt" "work todo" entry
	 (file+headline "~/Documents/org/organized_org/professional.org" "Scratch")
	 (file "~/Documents/org/organized_org/wcap.org"))
	("P" "Personal Templates")
	("Pt" "Personal Todo" entry
	 (file+headline "~/Documents/org/study.org" "Scratch")
	 (file "~/Documents/org/organized_org/ptodo.org"))
	("Pb" "Personal Book" entry
	 (file+headline "~/Documents/org/organized_org/book-review.org" "Books")
	 "* %U - %^{Title}\nComments: %?")
	("Pi" "Idea" entry
	 (file+headline "~/Documents/org/organized_org/idea-scratch.org" "Idea")
	 "* %U - %^{Title}\nComments: %?")))
#+END_SRC

* Ordered Tasks
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       7e55a0fe-a6eb-4ca2-af10-9e2a8dc34e56
  :END:

In this section we learn how to enforce that tasks are completed in a predefined order

Suppose we have the following:

** DONE Build A House [100%]                                        :ORDERED:
   CLOSED: [2020-12-17 Thu 19:05]
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ORDERED:  t
   :ID:       69faac48-200b-4fec-a4a7-bae4b92c75d6
   :END:
   - State "NEXT"       from "TODO"       [2020-12-17 Thu 19:04]
*** DONE Build the basement
    CLOSED: [2020-12-17 Thu 19:02] SCHEDULED: <2020-12-17 Thu>
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID:       6ed67704-e8ef-4745-a170-33be9151563b
    :END:
    - State "WAITING"    from "TODO"       [2020-12-17 Thu 19:02]
*** DONE Build the ground floor
    CLOSED: [2020-12-17 Thu 19:04] SCHEDULED: <2020-12-18 Fri>
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID:       b3f0d0b3-0d91-4e96-b014-6b415bf4527d
    :END:
*** DONE Build the roof
    CLOSED: [2020-12-17 Thu 19:04] SCHEDULED: <2020-12-19 Sat>
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID:       5a71de47-3488-4085-9c49-c0dea12e5518
    :END:
*** DONE Build out doors and windows
    CLOSED: [2020-12-17 Thu 19:04]
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID:       79b608cd-725e-45f5-91aa-51ad5da2842e
    :END:
- [X] Doors
- [X] Windows

 We can add a special property called ordered which is placed on the parent task. The keybinding is C-c C-x shift-O

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; set up an ordered tag when ordered is called
(setq org-track-ordered-property-with-tag 1)

;; block the parent task from being marked done if subtasks aren't completed
(setq org-enforce-todo-dependencies t)
(setq org-enforce-todo-checkbox-dependencies t)
#+END_SRC

* Timers
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Timers_and_things
:ID:       3a0b2397-b52d-4216-b9ff-6c34443ea181
:END:
The key binding for starting a countdown timer is *C-c C-x ;*
There is also a count up timer: *C-c C-x 0*
We can pause timers: *C-c C-x ,*
and resume them with the same binding 
If we want to stop the timer, we prefix it with C-u -- so *C-u C-c C-x ,*


We can insert 
simple timestamps  with *C-c C-x .* 0:00:00 0:00:07
descriptive timestamps with C-c C-x - 
- 0:00:48 :: task 1
- 0:00:55 :: task 2
- 0:00:59 :: task 3
- 0:01:01 :: task 4
- 0:01:40 :: task 5

* Clocking
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       fdda37ed-a439-4010-a9dc-87bb04fd54fc
  :END:
<<Clocking Section>>
This is helpful for knowing how long tasks take. It could also be useful in the future if I want to charge by the hour for tasks (i.e. contract work or timesheet work).

To clock in, place the cursor on a task and press C-c C-x C-i (like clock in)
To clock out, we do C-c C-x C-o (like clock out)
If you accidentally clocked into the wrong task, you can cancel the clock with C-c C-x C-q


** Example Task 1 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       b83dd25e-2c2f-456e-8d69-580c0fdc9244
   :END:
   :LOGBOOK:
   CLOCK: [2020-12-17 Thu 19:38]--[2020-12-17 Thu 20:08] =>  0:30
   CLOCK: [2020-12-17 Thu 19:33]--[2020-12-17 Thu 19:34] =>  0:01
   :END:
** Example Task 2 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       97b5c704-fa12-45f8-9542-48afff233e6c
   :END:
   :LOGBOOK:
   CLOCK: [2020-12-17 Thu 19:37]--[2020-12-17 Thu 19:38] =>  0:01
   CLOCK: [2020-12-17 Thu 19:37]--[2020-12-17 Thu 19:37] =>  0:00
   CLOCK: [2020-12-17 Thu 19:35]--[2020-12-17 Thu 19:36] =>  0:01 
   :END:

We can also log breaks. If we clock out of a task, we can clock back into that previous task with C-c C-x C-x

Suppose we mostly work on just a few tasks throughout the day. We can get a menu of tasks with C-u C-c C-x C-x . With this we can choose a task to clock into from recent tasks. 

If we want to see the data on the tasks we have been working on, we can do C-c C-x C-d for an overview of how much time has been spent overall on each task.

* Column View
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       0beb03fd-47a7-4f3b-bc41-56630d1e174c
  :END:

Column view offers viewing the org file in a table structure. 

The definition can be done on a global level or a subtree level

#+COLUMNS: %58ITEM(Task) %7TODO %6CLOCKSUM(Clock)

To switch to column view, use C-c C-x C-c
If we want to leave column view, we just press q while at the heading for which it was enabled 

* Effort Estimates
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       1e2265c7-0cfd-4c70-bfba-2deb5fe4435a
  :END:

org offers the EFFORT property to keep track of estimates of effort

#+PROPERTY: Effort_All 0:10 0:20 0:30 1:00 2:00 4:00 6:00 8:00

We can also add this to column view

#+COLUMNS: %58ITEM(Details) %8Effort(Time){:} %6CLOCKSUM(Clock)

** Another Task
   :PROPERTIES:
   :Effort:   0:05
   :ID:       44a42b37-afa0-4221-93fa-60a8859e0e7c
   :END:
   :LOGBOOK:
   CLOCK: [2020-12-17 Thu 20:11]--[2020-12-17 Thu 20:28] =>  0:17
   CLOCK: [2020-12-17 Thu 20:08]--[2020-12-17 Thu 20:10] =>  0:02

#+TITLE: Linking, Attachments, and More

* Linking (Internal)
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       93bb8e4c-4549-4530-a54d-1004a58ecd92
  :END:

We can target the following with internal links: 

- Headlines
  - [ [a headline] ]
    - [[Ordered Tasks]]

- Named Targets: #+NAME: or <<target>>
  - [ [Name Target][Named target with description text] ]
    - [[Column View][This is the section of column views]]

- Custom IDs: CUSTOM_ID Property
  - [ [#MyID123] ]
    - [[Clocking Section][Link to clocking section]]
      - Link to [[#Timers_and_things][Custom ID Timers]]

- Radio Targets
  - <<<radio_target>>>
  - radio targets are activated with C-c C-c. Once activated every occurrence of the target string will transform into a link to that target
    - <<<swiss>>>


The swiss army chainsaw of text editing is emacs. That said, it did not originate in swiss territories.

We can edit links with C-c C-l
We can follow a link with C-c C-o (like open)
We can return to where we came from with C-c &

* Linking (External)
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       6592f18c-96ae-46e6-ac34-5ad17f716c96
  :END:

The syntax for linking to other files is usually protocol:location. 

For example, for an external url [ [url][url-description] ] or [[duckduckgo.com][duckduckgo]]

** Link to unique IDs
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       9a43a414-1b2a-46fd-8505-4b3f5d47a8ae
   :END:

Org mode also has an ID property that is generated using the function `org-id-get-create` and creates a 25 digit UUID for the item that has the cursor.


** Example item
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       ff6a0451-dfc7-4b60-9862-547a8a492090
   :END:

We can automate the id creation

** Adding IDs to all headlines when saving a file
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       19db2993-8270-4f1d-aa79-a387cd365b7f
   :END:

We define a small function that automatically adds the ID property with a unique ID to all headlines that have none when we save our current org file

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun my/org-add-ids-to-headlines-in-file ()
  "Add ID properties to all headlines in the current file which do not already have one"
  (interactive)
  (org-map-entries 'org-id-get-create))

(add-hook 'org-mode-hook
	  (lambda ()
	    (add-hook 'before-save-hook
		      'my/org-add-ids-to-headlines-in-file nil 'local)))
#+END_SRC

The first function says that if a headline already has an ID do nothing, otherwise make a new UUID.

Then we add it to our org-mode-hook before save. That way, when we save, it will execute the function before it saves it.

** Create an ID and copy the UUID to the clipboard
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       b5649c2c-9087-4733-ae09-b5e0512fb0d3
   :END:

We can define a function and bind it to a key. The function would create the UUID and then copy it to the kill ring. 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun my/copy-id-to-clipboard ()
  "Copy the ID property value to killring. If no ID present, create a new unique ID.
   This only works in org mode buffers."
  (interactive)
  (when (eq major-mode 'org-mode)
    (setq mytmpid (funcall 'org-id-get-create))
    (kill-new mytmpid)
    (message "Copied %s to killring" mytmpid)))


(global-set-key (kbd "s-i") 'my/copy-id-to-clipboard)

"19db2993-8270-4f1d-aa79-a387cd365b7f"
#+END_SRC

[[id:19db2993-8270-4f1d-aa79-a387cd365b7f][something]]

* Attachments
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       143426d0-36d2-48c5-ae01-571a6674f3c2
  :END:

In this less we will lead to to add external files to our items. 

Attachments are stored on the hard drive. We have two possibilities to specify where the attachments should end up:

** Use the ID property
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       15a25898-28e7-4c4c-91d7-cd227ef5d4df
   :END:

If the node that gets a file attached has an ID property, then the file will be stored under a directory that is named after the UUID assigned to the item. 
We can customize the variable org-attach-id-dir to set a path to where those ID related directories should be created. 

** Use DIR property
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       02f01591-aa41-4b5b-a844-1991022895a4
   :END:

If we have a dir property, then this will specify the location where they are stored. 

If we want to have an attachment structure that is closely bound to the items, we should go with the ID method.

** Invoking Org Attach                                               :ATTACH:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       b4736c2a-da54-4aef-88f0-4738f8ff32ed
   :END:

We can look at attached items with C-c C-a as well. We can also link to attachments

[ [attachment:file.txt] [description] ]

[[attachment:ptodo.txt][an agenda template for todos]]

* Priorities
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       62ae6af2-6c91-437c-ab9c-ed636d3c98fc
  :END:

In this lesson we learn which tools Org-mode offers to define priorities for tasks

*** [#A] Item 1
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID:       d363ee0c-2311-4df6-aea8-a7d0bf24d300
    :END:
*** [#B] Item 2
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID:       9b6d0912-b46e-4ebc-a203-09832d0b49a6
    :END:
*** [#C] Item 3
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID:       02ca74a5-8dc9-418c-bb82-f573618ee480
    :END:

In our agenda view, we will see the items with the highest priority on top and tasks with no priority at the bottom.

We can also set custom priorities with the tag (highest lowest default):

#+PRIORITIES 1 5 3

* Tables
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       331ea93b-3fc0-4f5a-813b-ad8e4996a12a
