     I worked on the library table today.
     
     Features added include: 
     
     - names of uploaded files, mailto for owner, links to uploaded file and link to summary
     - Most of the long title hiding was implemented
     - First steps toward adding an ibuffer under the table when file links have been clicked were implemented
     
     I also added more buttons for the pdf upload (for the summarization part), and cleaned up the look of the other tabs
